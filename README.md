# Project_KDD

This contains the source code for my indie project in the making, Kirby Dark Doom

## Summary
This game is a passion idea that I had a while back, but I never had the chance to enact on it. In order to gain more experience in game development and as a game developer, I am aiming to develop a small prototype of this project. All of its code will be here for others to see. This section will also he a heavy WIP as the project moves along.

## Project Goals
The driving factor behind this prototype is to achevie the following:
1. Develop a concept idea from scratch, using only a design document as the basis
2. Develop best practices when it comes to scripting funtionalities
3. Understand the optimal workflow when it comes to Unity development
4. Rapidly develop a prototype that could be used in the future

## What's in here?
This project will consist of a short prototype level that will demonstrate all of the mechanics, UI, and fludidity that I worked on. A complete playthrough of the prototype will take less than 3 minutes. 

## Basic Controls
- `A`: Move Left
- `D`: Move Right
- `S`: Duck/Swallow (if something is in the player's mouth)
- `W`: Enter door
- `H`: Inhale/Exhale
- `Space`: Jump/Fly
> Refer to the [documentation](Documentation/) for more specific actions that the player can do

## Win Condiion
> The player safely navigates the three areas of the prototype and enters the `GoalDoor` that is colored yellow.

## Lose Condition
> The player loses all of their lives before reaching the `GoalDoor`
