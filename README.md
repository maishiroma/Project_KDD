# Project_KDD

This contains the source code for my indie project in the making, Kirby Dark Doom

## Summary
This game is a passion idea that I had a while back, but I never had the chance to enact on it. In order to gain more experience in game development and as a game developer, I am aiming to develop a small prototype of this project. All of its code will be here for others to see. This section will also he a heavy WIP as the project moves along.

> DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT own the rights to any of the characters used in this game. They are apart of their respective owners, in this case, Nintendo. I am only using these mediums to help push my coding experience to the next level. I will not sell this project or market anything in this game that I did not create on my own as my own. I will make sure all credit is given to whom it is necessary.
